ðŸ“ˆ Model Evaluation  

After training the linear regression model, the following metrics were reported:

Mean Absolute Error (MAE): ~8.43

Mean Squared Error (MSE): ~103.92

Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): ~10.19

These results indicate that the model performs reasonably well, with predictions typically off by around 8â€“10 units on average.
